# Smart-Traffic-Signal-for-Emergency-Vehicles

Abstract

Traffic Monitoring and Management is one of the most difficult challenges being faced by many metro cities these days. In this project we will implement a method to dynamically schedule the traffic signals so as to dissolve the traffic jams and allow easy movement of emergency vehicles on the road. Existing ideas include controlling a traffic light using timers for each lane, employing electronic sensors for detecting vehicles. Another way is with the help of traffic police, when he notices the ambulance. In this project we will use An Arduino UNO Microcontroller, RFID reader module and RFID tag. RFID reader detects RFID tag in its proximity and updates the Arduino with the RFID tag number. The RFID tag comes along with a coil and a chip inside it. When this ID comes in good proximity to the reader, electricity is induced in the coil by the method of electromagnetic induction which powers up the chip. With the help of RFID tag the ambulance when required to pass through signals the signal becomes green by keeping all other signals at the junction red. This helps to pass the ambulance without waiting for green signal in thickly populated areas / traffic areas.
